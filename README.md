### Hi Some Importance of ethical factorsðŸ‘‹

Many or even most ethical codes cover the following areas:

Honesty and Integrity
   
   This means that you need to report your research honestly, and that this applies to your methods (what you did), your data, your results, and whether you have previously published any of it. You should not make up any data, including extrapolating unreasonably from some of your results, or do anything which could be construed as trying to mislead anyone. It is better to undersell than over-exaggerate your findings.

   When working with others, you should always keep to any agreements, and act sincerely.

   Objectivity

   You should aim to avoid bias in any aspect of your research, including design, data analysis, interpretation, and peer review. For example, you should never recommend as a peer reviewer someone you know, or who you have worked with, and you should try to ensure that no groups are inadvertently excluded from your research. This also means that you need to disclose any personal or financial interests that may affect your research.

Carefulness

Take care in carrying out your research to avoid careless mistakes. You should also review your work carefully and critically to ensure that your results are credible. It is also important to keep full records of your research. If you are asked to act as a peer reviewer, you should take the time to do the job effectively and fully.

Openness

You should always be prepared to share your data and results, along with any new tools that you have developed, when you publish your findings, as this helps to further knowledge and advance science. You should also be open to criticism and new ideas.

  Respect for Intellectual Property

You should never plagiarise, or copy, other peopleâ€™s work and try to pass it off as your own. You should always ask for permission before using other peopleâ€™s tools or methods, unpublished data or results. Not doing so is plagiarism. Obviously, you need to respect copyrights and patents, together with other forms of intellectual property, and always acknowledge contributions to your research. If in doubt, acknowledge, to avoid any risk of plagiarism.

Confidentiality

You should respect anything that has been provided in confidence. You should also follow guidelines on protection of sensitive information such as patient records.

Responsible Publication

You should publish to advance to state of research and knowledge, and not just to advance your career. This means, in essence, that you should not publish anything that is not new, or that duplicates someone elseâ€™s work.

Legality

You should always be aware of laws and regulations that govern your work, and be sure that you conform to them.
